  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Parrots are fascinating and intelligent birds that make wonderful pets. Proper care is essential to ensure their well-being and longevity. This guide will cover the basics of parrot care to help you create a healthy and happy environment for your feathered friend.</p>

  <h2>Cage Size and Space</h2>
  <p>Parrots need a spacious cage to thrive. Make sure to provide them with a large cage that allows them plenty of room to move around. Include perches, swings, and ladders for added enrichment. The cage should be placed in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight and drafts.</p>

  <h2>Handling</h2>
  <p>While it's essential to bond with your parrot, avoid excessive handling. Parrots need their space and may become stressed if handled too often. When handling your parrot, do so gently and respectfully, allowing it to come to you when it feels comfortable.</p>

    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Blueberries</li>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Chalk (for toxin binding)</li>

    <li>Treat sticks</li>
    <li>Peanuts in shell</li>
    <li>Table scraps (in moderation)</li>
